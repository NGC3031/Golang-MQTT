GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Code in /app/lib

Design is a simple MVC pattern. The aim was to keep it as simple as possible. Libraries are the original go websocket
 library which is less functional than gorilla but seemed a bit lighter weight for this project.
Paho was used for MQTT as that seems to be the default standard.
The controller creates an HTTP server and a Websocket server and then starts reading the MQTT messages, GO unmarshall is
then used to extract the level as an integer which is then tested and a new MQTT message is then published with the 
current status >50 or <=50. 
Finally the struct is updated with the latest level number which is the pushed to the client.
The client itself is fairly basic using just a simple bootstrap template and a meter element. Again trying to keep it as
 simple and lightweight as possible. This can easily be customised and developed further to suit specific devices.
Without knowing any specific details this was kept as generic as possible.
The code can also be easily upgraded to push additional readings to the client through JSON if needed. Although that was
not done at this point, it would be assumed that there would be additional display data being sent to the client in a real
world application.

All working, but testing has not been completed as no time at this point.
